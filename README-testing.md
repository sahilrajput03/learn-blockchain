**Another truffle watch project:**
- `truffle-watch`: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle-watch), [github](https://github.com/lsankar4033/truffle-watch) (installation says node-gyp error and I need to have node version 10 IMO to fix this {from some stackoverflow answer}).

## truffle lazy testing sucksss

A simple single contract test takes 17 seconds to execute with truffle test command.

There is no test watch mode support from truffle suite and they don't care to support it (from their previous github issues). :(
