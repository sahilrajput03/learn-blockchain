**Project Ideas:**
- Ecommerce app (FT/NFT/SFT?)
- Social media app (FT+NFT)
- Car resale business so we can have nfts of cars (using chasi id) (NFT)

## string concatenation


*Older way to concat string was: `string(abi.encodePacked(a, b))`. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69932390/10012446)*

Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/70987389/10012446

```sol
contract Implementation {
    using Strings for string;

    string a = "first";
    string b = "second";
    string public c;
    
    constructor() {
        c = a.concat(b); // "firstsecond"
    }
}
```

## get length of `bytes` type variable in solidity?

`bytes memory byteStr = bytes(a)`

So in above we first convert string to bytes type and then we can use `.length` method to calculate the length of it.

## storage, memory and calldata

- storage: you should use this to load dynamic data that you'll update
- memory: if you only need to read the data or modify it without saving it onto the blockchain
- calldata: for function inputs you can use it to save gas (check SS: If we don't use calldata then the variable's data is copied to the target funciton as well when we call `_internal` fn and it would have cost more gas. Thus in order to save gas you can use `caldata` to save gas while calling different functions as we do in this case).

**READ Todo:** LogRocket Article: [Click here](https://blog.logrocket.com/ultimate-guide-data-types-solidity/)

Understanding solidity data types from Oreily:

The bytes data type in Solidity is a dynamically sized byte[] array. As it's dynamic sized, the length of this type can grow and shrink. The bytes type is a bit different from bytes1 , bytes2, ... bytes31, and bytes32 types (stepping 1), as bytes stores tightly packed data, whereas bytesN does not. 

The bytes type variables are initialized with an empty string. If you check with the Remix IDE, it will return 0x, meaning a byte[] array with a length of 0.

There is no operator supported directly on bytes, but sometimes you might need to compare the two bytes variables. To check equality, you can compute the keccak256 hash of both the variables and perform a comparison, like that shown in following code example: ...

## business applications of blockchain

Source: [Article](https://balticassist.com/5-applications-for-blockchain-in-the-business-world-6/)

Blockchain technology consists of a distributed ledger, like a Google Document that is accessible by those who have permission to a given blockchain network. Each change one makes to the ledger must be approved by the many computers – known as nodes – that comprise the chain. So, while the blockchain ledger has the benefit of being accessible from virtually any place across the globe, it also offers a level of security that traditional alternatives often do not. The downside, as of now, is that the blockchain is not infinitely scalable, so specific processes – logging and processing Visa’s daily transactions, for example – aren’t fit for blockchain adoption. 

### 5 Applications for Blockchain in the Business World

Source: [Click here](https://balticassist.com/5-applications-for-blockchain-in-the-business-world-6/)

1. Supply Chain Management: Supply chains are the organizational and logistical systems by which goods are transported from a factory, extractor, or grower to the consumer, and they are typically complicated systems that can span the globe. Most of these systems are comprised of independent databases whose records are kept centrally. This can make acquiring verifiable information about shipments and processes nearly impossible for the person tasked with supply chain management, as opacity and fragmentation can disrupt any unity they hope to install throughout the links in the supply chain. This is where blockchain incorporation could be of excellent service. The blockchain is a single, decentralized ledger, meaning that all parties on a supply chain could log their information into that ledger once they have the proper permission.

2. Incorporating Regulators More Seamlessly: From insurance to lending and government, regulators abound. As of now, cooperating with regulatory agencies is a hassle. Audits and processes which require a business to virtually halt their operations and sift through rooms-worth of files to appease regulatory agents are an owner’s nightmare, but fortunately, the blockchain holds the promise of a better way.

3. Improved Record Keeping/Sharing: Have you ever actually tried to go to your local records hall and acquire information? If you’re not a journalist or lawyer, there’s a good chance that the answer is ‘no’. Good for you, because current systems of large-scale recordkeeping are nightmarish in most cases, and nonexistent in others. If a system could be digitized and secured along the blockchain, records requests would be a breeze, and municipalities and corporations could save money by eschewing physical space, employees, and systems that are operational dinosaurs.

4. Voting: The blockchain can provide a means by which votes are issued securely, with that vote being tied to a person’s unique identification metadata. Such a system would streamline the process and ensure that democratic systems aren’t existing in theory only, but are put into practice in a way that reflects the geographic and financial constraints that most people are subject to.

5. Financial Management: This is perhaps the industry with the most significant promise for blockchain incorporation. We’ve already seen how cryptocurrencies can impact the financial world as an investment and speculative currency, but the blockchain – the technology upon which cryptos are made possible – could better protect user data, streamline transactions (especially across borders), and create an unalterable ledger which is more effective in preventing fraud and malfeasance.

## returning 2d array from a function in solidity

**Project Reference: `open_voting.sol`**

Why to bother to return 2d arrays? Becoz in solidity we can not return mapping type from functions thus we must need to return 2d arrays form of data from the functions.

Tip:
- Constructor arguments are automatically fetched for this contract by etherscan from the first transaction data I guess as one person suggested to get it [manually here on stackoverflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/37649/106687).

## What are `absract contract`

Soure of below points: [Click here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solidity-abstract-contract/)

Abstract contracts are contracts:
- that have at least one function without its implementation
- you don’t provide arguments for all of the base contract constructors
- we don’t intend to create a contract directly we can consider the contract to be abstract
- instance of an abstract cannot be created

Abstract contracts:
- are used as base contracts so that the child contract can inherit and utilize its functions
- defines the structure of the contract and any derived contract inherited from it should provide an implementation for the incomplete functions


**Another good example and different contextual usage of [abstract contract is here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solidity-abstract-contract/).**

https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-verify-with-hardhat-or-truffle-a-smart-contract-using-openzeppelin-contracts/4119

Add to your `hardhat.config.js`: `require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan");` and configure the etherscan api key in the same file as well.  And running below command:

`npx hardhat verify --network mainnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1"`

## successful in verifying contract of kbmarket using hardhat with cli command only

NOTE: For these verify scripts to work I need to replace the addresses manaully for now. (todo: Since the config-goerli.js uses ecma exports its difficult to import file as regular nodejs module).

## SFT's Semi-Fungible Tokens

Source: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4sNXHLP9qY)@ youtube by MagicEden (i.e., https://magiceden.io/)

- SFT's are (simply NFT's which) can be minted quantity of greater than one
- Multiple SFT's can have same mint address and can still be saved on blockchain
- They possess the properties of both NFT's and FT's. Source: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtnBwfIEFg0)
    - Consider you have two coupon's which expire on different dates so before they any one of them gets expired you can think of them as fungible token becoz you can exchange them without losing value. But say when one is expired after that one is not valid anymore whereas the other one is valid so there's the NFT property on these tokens.
    - A concert ticket can also be considered as SFT, the FT component comes from the fact that if we were to exchange ticket technically would bring the same value in the fact that both of us would attend the concert, but the NFT component would be that our seats would be different e.g., one seat could be closer to the scene whereas the other one does not.
    - Another example is like say your character has a collection of items, then instead of minting them NFT token for each of those items you can bundle them together and it would be represented as single SFT that could be fraction if needed. One of the item from the bundle could be resole or traded.

Simple comparisons Date: 8 Nov, 2022

- **Cost of DEPLOYING ERC20 CONTRACT**

    1. I deployed to Mumbai testnet, it costs to me: 0.00037$ 🏆😍 {30 Paise}
    2. And deploying to BNB testnet, it costs to me: $ 4.12😪 {Rs. 337}
    3. And deploying to Goerli testnet, it costs to me: 12-15$ 🥶 {Rs. 980-1230}

    *(I calculated this by checking the current price of MATIC, ETH and BNB  prices then converting transaction fees to dollars of both of these contract deployment).*

## ethereum 2.0 or Serenity

Below image shows that how a validator stackes his eth (i.e, min 32ETH) to become a validator(there's no concept of miner in PoS) and thus he/she can earn the txns fees for the tx it completes successfully.

Also, in case if the validator try to tamper with with block then all his stacke will not be returned and also the txn fees will not be offered:

PoS works on **Risk and Rewards** basis i.e., who ever stakes more ETH will have  more probability of getting selected in the opportunity to validate a block. (whereas in PoW it happens with the competitive war between nodes).
